# Screenshot Manager - Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This project aims to demonstrate modern web application development using Azure technology stack and .NET 8. Through building a practical screenshot management system, we will showcase the following technical components.

## Primary Objectives

### Technical Demonstration
- **Azure App Service** for web application hosting
- **Azure Blob Storage** for file management
- **Azure AI Foundry** for image analysis (later stages)
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **.NET 8** latest features utilization

### Development Methodology Practice
- **Specification-Driven Development** - Documentation-first approach
- **Component-Based Design** - Maintainable architecture
- **Incremental Development** - Crawl/Walk/Run approach
- **AI Pair Programming** - Collaborative development with Claude Code

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Business professionals who frequently take screenshots
- Project managers who need to organize screen captures as documentation
- UI/UX designers, developers, and product managers

### Secondary Users
- Team members involved in screen sharing and review processes
- Technical documentation authors

## Problems to Solve

### Current Issues
- Screenshots scattered across local folders
- Limitations of filename-based organization
- Difficulty searching through historical screen content
- Inefficient team sharing processes

### Value Proposition
- **Automated Organization**: AI-powered content analysis and auto-tagging
- **Efficient Search**: OCR-based text search capabilities
- **Cloud Management**: Access from anywhere
- **Team Collaboration**: Secure and efficient sharing features

## Technical Constraints

### Required Components
- .NET 8 or higher
- Azure subscription
- GitHub account (for CI/CD)

### Recommended Environment
- Azure AI Foundry access (Walk stage and beyond)
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## Success Criteria

### As Technical Demonstration
- [ ] Proper utilization of Azure resources

- [ ] Incremental development methodology demonstration
- [ ] AI feature integration proof-of-concept

### As Practical Application
- [ ] Intuitive UI/UX
- [ ] Stable file upload functionality
- [ ] Efficient search capabilities
- [ ] Responsive design

## Project Constraints

### Time Constraints
- Each stage must be independently functional and complete
- Always maintain demo-ready state

### Technical Constraints
- Implementation within Azure free tier limitations
- Adherence to security best practices
- Scalability-conscious design

### Feature Constraints
- Crawl stage: Basic file management only
- Walk stage: Incremental AI feature addition
- Run stage: Advanced analysis and search capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Detailed roadmap planning (01-ROADMAP.md)
2. System architecture design (02-ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Feature specification detailing (03-FEATURES.md)
4. Technical implementation details (04-TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
