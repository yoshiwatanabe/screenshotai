# Screenshot Manager - Project Overview

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates modern desktop application development using .NET 8 with a **privacy-first, local-only approach**. Through building a practical screenshot management system, we showcase secure, offline-capable desktop development with optional AI integrations.

## Primary Objectives

### Technical Demonstration
- **Local File Storage** for secure, privacy-first data management
- **Desktop Application** with modern .NET 8 patterns
- **AI Integration Options** (API-based or local models)
- **Component-Based Architecture** for maintainable code
- **.NET 8** latest features utilization

### Development Methodology Practice
- **Specification-Driven Development** - Documentation-first approach
- **Component-Based Design** - Maintainable architecture
- **Incremental Development** - Crawl/Walk/Run approach
- **AI Pair Programming** - Collaborative development with Claude Code

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Business professionals who frequently take screenshots
- Project managers who need to organize screen captures as documentation
- UI/UX designers, developers, and product managers

### Secondary Users
- Team members involved in screen sharing and review processes
- Technical documentation authors

## Problems to Solve

### Current Issues
- Screenshots scattered across local folders
- Limitations of filename-based organization
- Difficulty searching through historical screen content
- Inefficient team sharing processes

### Value Proposition
- **Privacy Protection**: All screenshots stored locally, never uploaded to cloud
- **Offline Operation**: Works completely without internet connection
- **AI Enhancement**: Optional AI analysis while keeping data local
- **Fast Performance**: Direct file system access for instant operations
- **Zero Storage Costs**: Use your own disk space, no cloud fees

## Technical Constraints

### Required Components
- .NET 8 or higher
- Local file system access
- Windows, macOS, or Linux desktop

### Optional Components
- API keys for AI services (OpenAI, Azure AI, etc.)
- Local AI models (Ollama, etc.) for offline AI features

## Success Criteria

### As Technical Demonstration
- [x] Privacy-first local storage implementation
- [x] Modern .NET 8 component architecture
- [x] Incremental development methodology demonstration
- [ ] AI feature integration proof-of-concept

### As Practical Application
- [ ] Intuitive desktop UI/UX
- [x] Reliable local file management
- [ ] Efficient search capabilities
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility

## Project Constraints

### Time Constraints
- Each stage must be independently functional and complete
- Always maintain demo-ready state

### Technical Constraints
- Local storage limitations (user's available disk space)
- Adherence to privacy and security best practices
- Cross-platform compatibility requirements

### Feature Constraints
- Crawl stage: Basic file management only
- Walk stage: Incremental AI feature addition
- Run stage: Advanced analysis and search capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Detailed roadmap planning (01-ROADMAP.md)
2. System architecture design (02-ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Feature specification detailing (03-FEATURES.md)
4. Technical implementation details (04-TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
