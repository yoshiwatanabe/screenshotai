## Cross-Stage Considerations

### Architecture Evolution
```
Crawl:  Simple MVC ‚Üí Blob Storage
Walk:   Add AI Services ‚Üí Enhanced Models
Run:    Microservices ‚Üí Advanced Features
```

### Database Strategy
- **Crawl**: In-memory/simple file metadata
- **Walk**: Azure SQL Database for AI metadata
- **Run**: Advanced indexing and search optimization

### Security Progression
- **Crawl**: Basic Azure authentication
- **Walk**: Enhanced access controls
- **Run**: Enterprise-grade security features

### Performance Targets
- **Crawl**: < 5s upload time for 10MB files
- **Walk**: < 10s AI processing time
- **Run**: < 2s search response time

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI API Limits**: Implement rate limiting and fallback strategies
- **Storage Costs**: Monitor usage and implement optimization
- **Performance**: Load testing at each stage

### Demo Risks
- **Live Coding**: Always maintain working previous stage
- **Network Issues**: Prepare offline demos as backup
- **Azure Limits**: Monitor quotas and have backup plans

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- Code coverage: > 80% at each stage
- Build time: < 2 minutes
- Deployment time: < 5 minutes

### Demo Metrics
- Feature completion rate: 100% per stage
- Bug-free demo execution: Target 95%
- Audience engagement: Measurable interest in each component
