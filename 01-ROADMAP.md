## Cross-Stage Considerations

### Architecture Evolution
```
Crawl:  Desktop App ‚Üí Local Storage
Walk:   Add Local AI ‚Üí Enhanced Local Models
Run:    Advanced Features ‚Üí Local Analytics
```

### Database Strategy
- **Crawl**: Local file system metadata
- **Walk**: SQLite database for AI metadata and search
- **Run**: Advanced local indexing and full-text search

### Privacy Progression
- **Crawl**: Complete local storage, no network
- **Walk**: Optional AI services with user consent
- **Run**: Advanced privacy controls and data encryption

### Performance Targets
- **Crawl**: < 1s local file save for 10MB images
- **Walk**: < 5s local AI processing time
- **Run**: < 500ms search response time (local)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Local AI Performance**: Optimize for different hardware capabilities
- **Disk Storage**: Monitor usage and implement cleanup strategies
